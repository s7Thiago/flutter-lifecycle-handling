# flutter_lifecycle_handling

A new Flutter project.

## App Study Case

This project is a showcase implementation of app life-cycles on a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- the app contains a Timer that automatically increments a text on the UI
- The Timer pauses when the application is minimized
